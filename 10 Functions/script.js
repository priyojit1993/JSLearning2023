  Coding Challenge #1
Let's build a simple poll app!
A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an
array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter
'poll' object below.
Your tasks:
1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The
method does 2 things:
1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the
selected option. The prompt should look like this:
What is your favourite programming language?
0: JavaScript
1: Python
2: Rust
3: C++
(Write option number)
1.2. Based on the input number, update the 'answers' array property. For
example, if the option is 3, increase the value at position 3 of the array by
1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes
sense (e.g. answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The
method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string'
or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using
console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a
string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each
'registerNewAnswer' method call.
5. Bonus: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test
data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do not put the arrays in the poll
object! So what should the this keyword look like in this situation?

//Immedietly invoked function expression (IIFE)
//function that dissapears after its called once(needed for async await)

const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;
  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passenger count`);
  };
};
const booker = secureBooking();
//here when we call the secureBooking() function and store in the variable in the call stack it gets executed and removed and since the passengerCount variable was a part of the secureBooking function so its scope was limited to it
//Now when we call the booker() which internally calls the function returned by secureBooking() ideally this booker() is in the global scope and should not have access to passengerCount which was defined in the secureBooking() method but shockinlgy it does have access because of the feature called closure.
//Closure states that a function has access to the variables environment(VE) of the execution context in which it was created/defined and since the secureBooking() method is returning a method which we are storing in book variable but the method was created inside the context of secureBooking() so it is able to still access the passengerCount variable even when the secureBooking() function execution context has finished its execution and is not in the call stack
//VE attached to the function,exactly as it was at the time and place when the function was created.
booker();
booker();
booker();
//closure is the closed over variable-environment of the execution context in which the function was created even after the execution context is gone.
//closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function even after that parent function has returned. The inner function keeps a refference to its outer scope.which preserves the scope chain throughout time.
//in the below example altough the variable f was defined in global scope but since it was assigned inside the g function scope and in the assignment of f variable a function was attached whose definition lied within the scope of g() so even after g() execution is completed and its moved out of call stack f()  is still able to access the variable a which was defined inside ths scope of g() due to closure property
let f;
const g = function () {
  const a = 23;
  f = function () {
    console.log(a * 2);
  };
};

 * This is more of a thinking challenge than a coding challenge ๐ค
Your tasks:
1. Take the IIFE below and at the end of the function, attach an event listener that
changes the color of the selected h1 element ('header') to blue, each time
the body element is clicked. Do not select the h1 element again!
2. And now explain to yourself (or someone around you) why this worked! Take all
the time you need. Think about when exactly the callback function is executed,
and what that means for the variables involved in this example.
(function () {
const header = document.querySelector('h1');
header.style.color = 'red';
})();
 * 
 */
(function () {
  const header = document.querySelector('h1');
  header.style.color = 'red';
})();
