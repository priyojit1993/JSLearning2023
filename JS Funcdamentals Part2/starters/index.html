    <!-- 

    As we know that HTML is loaded and executed line by line. So, when the browser encounters a <script> tag, it loads and executes the javascript code on the spot. This may slow down the page rendering speed and thus webpage will take more time to load.
    Javascript is often used to manipulate DOM and add new functionality to the webpage. If <script> tag is not added at end of the <body> tag, DOM may not be ready by that time, thus preventing javascript to work on it, leading to unknown behaviors.
    Therefore, we should always add <script> tag at the end of the <body> tag to prevent unknown behaviors and make the webpage load faster.
